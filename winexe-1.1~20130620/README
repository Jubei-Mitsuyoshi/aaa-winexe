winexe
======

These instructions are for Ubuntu 12.10, but a similar procedure can be
followed for another distribution.

Winexe makes use of Samba 4.  Winexe can be built dynamically, resulting
in an executable less than one megabyte in size which is linked against
Samba 4 shared libraries, or statically, incorporating Samba 4 components
into an executable that is several megabytes in size.

First get software required for either kind of build.

    sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64

Instructions for shared-library build
-------------------------------------

Get dependencies.

    sudo apt-get install libdcerpc-dev libpopt-dev libsamba-credentials-dev
    sudo apt-get install libsamba-util-dev libsmbclient-raw-dev libtevent-dev
    sudo apt-get install samba4-dev libtalloc-dev

Build.

    cd source
    ./waf configure
    ./waf

Run.

    build/winexe --help

Instructions for static build
-----------------------------

Get dependencies, including the Samba 4 source tree which in this example
is downloaded to the present working directory.

    sudo apt-get install comerr-dev libpopt-dev libbsd-dev zlib1g-dev libc6-dev
    git clone git://git.samba.org/samba.git samba

Build. The argument of the "samba-dir" option is the path to the samba source
tree that was just downloaded. The "configure" step takes a long time because
it builds Samba 4.

    cd source
    ./waf configure --samba-dir=../samba
    ./waf

Run.

    build/winexe-static --help

The build system tries to find paths to headers and libraries, but you
can also specify these as follows.

    ./waf configure --samba-dir=../samba --samba-inc-dirs=...  --samba-lib-dirs=...

If you are interested only in the static version of winexe then
you can use "disable-shared" configuration option.

    ./waf configure --samba-dir=../samba --disable-shared
